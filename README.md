## TODOs

- Create System Requirements section in README
- Intro section explaining what it is / what it does
- Guarantee a driver.Quit() call at the end
- Start to stub out the CLI interaction
- May want to split out the interaction part as well as the "execute it" part?
- Consider allowing user to select the browser themselves?
- Any user preferences we would want to persist? Maybe we could use a sqllite db under the hood?
